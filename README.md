ðŸ“Œ Dataset Source
After searching online, I found a dataset on DoltHub, which filters through public datasets. The specific dataset I used is publicly available on GitHub:
ðŸ”— Netflix/metaflow - movies.csv: https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/blob/master/metaflow/tutorials/01-playlist/movies.csv
âš  NOTE: The original dataset was too large. It has been reduced to 500 rows (without sorting) to meet challenge specifications.

For easier execution, install the Code Runner extension in VS Code:

    Open VS Code
    Navigate to the Extensions tab (left sidebar)
    Search for "Code Runner"

Using Code Runner is more convenient than manually specifying the full directory path of your .py file.
