## 1. Where is the dataset from?

After searching online, I found a website called [dolt.com](https://www.dolt.com) that filters through public datasets. The dataset used for this challenge is publicly stored on GitHub:  
üîó [Netflix Metaflow Movies Dataset](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow/blob/master/metaflow/tutorials/01-playlist/movies.csv)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** The original dataset was too large. It has been reduced to 500 rows (without sorting) as per the challenge's specifications.
